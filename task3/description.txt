C++ DEVELOPMENT INTERNHSIP (TASK 3)

Project Title: Command-Line Library Management System
  
Project Description: Develop a C++ program that allows librarians or users to manage
library resources, including adding and removing books, checking book availability, and
displaying the library's catalog.
  
Steps you can Implement:

Book Data Structure: Define a data structure (e.g., a struct or class) to represent book
information, including attributes like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
Catalog Management: Create a data structure (e.g., an array or vector) to store the
library's collection of books.
  
User Interface: Design a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to
interact with the library system. Create a menu with options for adding, removing,
searching, and displaying books.
  
Add Books: Implement a function to add new books to the library catalog. Collect book
details (title, author, ISBN) from the user and add the book to the catalog.
  
Remove Books: Implement a function to remove books from the catalog based on
criteria like title or ISBN. Ensure the availability status is updated accordingly.
  
Book Availability: Implement a function to check the availability of a book by its title or
ISBN. Update the availability status when a book is borrowed or returned.
  
Display Catalog: Create a function to display the library's catalog, including book details
and availability status. Format the output for readability.
  
File Storage (Optional): Consider adding file storage functionality to save and load the
library's catalog from a file for persistence between program runs.

Input Validation: Implement input validation to handle errors and edge cases gracefully,
such as invalid ISBNs or book titles.
  
Documentation: Document your code, providing explanations for functions and
variables. Include user instructions on how to use the library management system.
