Project Title: Command-Line Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Project Description: Build a C++ program that allows two players to play a game of Tic-
Tac-Toe. The program should display the game board, handle player moves, check for a
win or a draw, and provide an option to play again.
  
Steps you can Implement:


Game Initialization: Initialize the game board, typically as a 3x3 grid, and display it to
the players. You can use a 2D array to represent the board.
  
Player Input: Implement a loop that takes player input for their moves. Ensure that the
input is valid (e.g., within the board boundaries and not already taken).


Board Updates: Update the game board with each player's move, displaying X or O in
the corresponding grid cell.
  
Win Condition: After each move, check if the current player has won the game. You'll
need to implement logic to check rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive
marks.
  
Draw Condition: Check if the game has ended in a draw (no available moves left on the
board).
  
Game Loop: Create a loop that allows players to take turns until there's a winner or a
draw. Display the updated board after each turn.
  
Game Over Message: Display a message when the game ends, indicating the winner or
a draw, and ask if the players want to play again.
  
Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure players enter valid moves (e.g.,
numeric values within the board boundaries).
  
Error Handling: Handle any potential errors or edge cases gracefully, such as players
entering invalid input.

Documentation: Document your code, explaining the purpose of functions and
variables, and provide clear instructions on how to play the game.
